Demo Walkthrough — 2–3 minute script for hiring panels

This short script helps you run a crisp demo during interviews. Follow these steps and call out the highlighted talking points.

1) Landing / Hero (30s)
   - Show the Hero, headline and primary CTA. Mention design intent: scannability and print-focused layout.

2) Template selector & Preview (45s)
   - Open Template Selector, pick Classic and show the Preview. Explain how data maps to template slots and how print rules keep sections aligned.

3) Quick AI refinement (45s)
   - Paste a short job description or bullet list and run the AI-enhance feature (summary or bullet rewrite). Show before/after and explain the prompt constraints.

4) Export & Print (30s)
   - Export to PDF or open the print preview. Show margins and page breaks.

Notes
- Keep it short and practice the flow once before interviews. Use HIRE_ME.md for talking points.
