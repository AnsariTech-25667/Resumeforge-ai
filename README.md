## Key features
- Multiple editable resume templates (Classic, Modern, Minimal, Minimal+Image)
- AI-assisted resume improvements (bullet refinement, summary generation)
- Export to PDF and printable layouts
- Simple, distraction-free UI focused on recruiter-readability

## Why I built this
I built ResumeForge AI to bridge the gap between design-forward resume templates and recruiter-friendly output. Drawing from my experience at Netraket (Denmark-based startup) and Softmaque Consulting, I understood the need for resumes that are both ATS-friendly and visually clear to human reviewers ‚Äî prioritizing scannability, semantic HTML for better parsing, and print-ready CSS.

## Implementation highlights
- React + Vite for fast developer experience and modern bundling
- Tailwind-style utility classes with a small global stylesheet for visual tokens and print rules
- Simple Redux store for managing resume drafts and template selection
- Server-side endpoints (Express) to demonstrate a deployable full-stack flow

If you'd like a one-page demo or a walkthrough video for hiring panels, I can prepare that and include it in the repo.

## Quick start (developer)
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies

```powershell
cd 'C:\path\to\resume-builder\client'
npm install
npm run dev

cd 'C:\path\to\resume-builder\server'
npm install
npm run server
```

2. Build for production (client)

```powershell
cd client
npm run build
```

3. Production deploy
- Build the client and serve the `client/dist` folder from any static host.
- Run the server (if you need the API) and set the `API_URL` in the client configs.

## How recruiters should evaluate this project
- Browse the demo and preview multiple templates.
- Check the `client/src/components/templates` folder to see the output HTML structure and Tailwind classes used for print-friendly layouts.
- Run the build to validate production readiness.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Commit this README and push the repo to a new remote you provide.
- Generate and add screenshots (I will run the app headlessly and capture images of the templates).
- Minify/optimize the large client chunk by introducing code-splitting recommendations.
