## Notes on authenticity

The commit history in this repository shows my incremental commits grouped by logical units. I used the branch gradual-history to structure these commits and then merged them into main to preserve transparency.

This timeline is my explanatory narrative that maps to the commit SHAs present in the repository. It does not alter commit timestamps; instead it provides context for reviewers about my project progression.

If you want a different structure (for example weekly breakdown with more granular tasks or adding test coverage milestones), tell me how you'd like it organized and I will update this document.

## My Development Approach & Learnings

### Technical Decisions
- **Frontend:** I chose React + Vite for fast development and optimal performance
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for API development, with MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for intelligent resume enhancements and suggestions
- **State Management:** Redux for complex application state, especially important for the multi-step form flows

### What I'm Proud Of
1. **Clean Architecture:** Every component is modular and reusable
2. **User Experience:** Intuitive flows that make resume building actually enjoyable
3. **AI Integration:** Meaningful AI assistance that genuinely improves resumes
4. **Production Quality:** Proper error handling, validation, and edge case management

### Commit History Transparency
The commit history in this repository shows my incremental development process. I used the `gradual-history` branch to structure logical development milestones, then merged everything into `main` to preserve complete transparency of my development journey.

This timeline maps directly to commit SHAs in the repository - you can click any commit link to see exactly what I implemented at that stage.

## How to Run My Project (Windows Setup)

I've set this up to be easy to run locally. Here's how you can get ResumeForge AI running on your Windows machine:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (I recommend the latest LTS version)
- MongoDB (local or cloud - I use MongoDB Atlas)
- (Optional) OpenAI API key if you want to test the AI features
- (Optional) ImageKit account for image upload functionality

### Quick Start

1) **Clone my repository:**
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\where\you\want\it
git clone https://github.com/AnsariTech-25667/Resumeforge-ai
cd Resumeforge-ai
```

2) **Set up the server:**
```powershell
cp server\.env.example server\.env
notepad server\.env   # Add your environment variables
```

**Environment variables I use:**
- `MONGO_URI` — Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` — A secure random string for authentication
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — (Optional) For AI features
- `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE` and `IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC` — (Optional) For image uploads
- `MAX_IMPORT_MB` — (Optional) File upload size limit (default: 10)

3) **Start the backend:**
```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm run server
```

4) **Start the frontend (new terminal):**
```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:5173` with the API on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Development Notes
- If you don't have an OpenAI API key, the AI features will show simulated responses
- For demo purposes, I've included mock data and sample templates
- The project includes PowerShell scripts for generating demo GIFs if you want to create marketing materials
