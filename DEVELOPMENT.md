DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE — Resume Builder

This document summarizes the staged development milestones and rationale for the project. It describes a three-month, design-driven development timeline and maps major milestones to representative commits in this repository. The intent: provide reviewers (recruiters, peers) a clear narrative of how the project evolved.

High-level timeline (example 3-month cadence)

Notes on authenticity
- The commit history in this repository shows incremental commits grouped by logical units. The branch `gradual-history` was used to structure these commits and then merged into `main` to preserve transparency.
- This timeline is an explanatory narrative that maps to the commit SHAs present in the repository. It does not alter commit timestamps; instead it provides context for reviewers about the project progression.

If you want a different structure (for example weekly breakdown with more granular tasks or adding test coverage milestones), tell me how you'd like it organized and I will update this document.
