Hire Me — Quick pitch, talking points & demo notes

Hi — I'm Maaz Ansari. If you're reading this repository as part of an interview, here's a short summary to speed things up:

- Role: Frontend Engineer (UI/UX focus, accessibility-minded)
- Highlights: design-forward templates, AI-assisted resume improvements, print-ready export
- Tech: React, Vite, minimal Redux, Express (server), pure-JS GIF capture

Talking points for interviews:
- Explain one technical tradeoff you made (e.g., pure-JS GIF assembly to avoid native deps) and why.
- Discuss how accessibility shaped component design (focus-visible, prefers-reduced-motion).
- Show the recruiter one-pager and the DEVELOPMENT.md timeline to explain your process.

Demo steps (2–3 minutes):
1) Open the app and show the Hero and Template Selector.
2) Create a short resume, use AI to refine bullets, and export PDF.
3) Show the preview and mention print-friendly CSS.
