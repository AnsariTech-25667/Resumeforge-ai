Commit & PR guide â€” keep history clear and professional

Use concise, conventional-commit style messages for clarity. Examples:

- feat: add resume templates
- fix: correct print margins in Classic template
- docs: add DEVELOPMENT.md and timeline
- chore: update package manifests

PR template suggestions:
- Title: feat: add <feature name>
- Description: short summary, rationale, testing instructions
- Checklist: runs locally, lint passes, accessibility checked

Why this matters: clean commit history is more persuasive to reviewers and recruiters. Use the HISTORY.md / DEVELOPMENT.md to explain milestones.
