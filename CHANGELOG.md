**Note**: This changelog begins with the repository standardization on 2025-10-26. Earlier development work (July-October 2025) was conducted locally and is documented in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) rather than backfilled in this changelog.

The initial public release represents a complete, production-ready platform developed over 3 months of intensive local development.
